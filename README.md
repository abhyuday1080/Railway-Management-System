# Railway-Management-System
Railway Management System website. Used SQL, HTML, CSS and PHP.

## To install and run on your PC:-

* Sign up and sign in in your SQL database.

* Run railway.sql and save database. 

* Add your SQL password and user name in an indicated portion of the db.php file.

* Make sure you have an active SQL database connection. To do so you can use local server solution software like xampp which is open source and easy to use, or deploy 
site on a web server connected to SQL.

## For deploying on local host using xampp:-

* Navigate to the folder where xampp is installed. Inside, there is a folder named htdocs, make a folder named railway there. The path would look like this-"~\xampp\htdocs\railway\". Place the project files in this folder.

* Go to xampp control panel and make sure MySQL service is in a running state.

* Open index.htm in your browser.

* Finally run index.htm and enjoy!
